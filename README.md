## Overview

Bladel is a competitive knife-making app developed using React Native and managed through Expo. It utilizes Firebase for backend services including database management, authentication, and storage. Bladel allows knife enthusiasts to participate in challenges, showcase their creations, and engage with a community of peers and experts. Judges can create new challenges, and participants can enter these challenges by submitting photos of their knives. Points are awarded based on community votes, and top performers are featured on a leaderboard.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration functionality.
- **Challenge Participation**: Users can enter knife-making challenges by submitting their work through the app.
- **Judge Role**: Selected users can become judges and have the authority to create new challenges.
- **Leaderboard**: Displays users with the highest total points.
- **Profile Management**: Users can view their entries and update their profile pictures.
- **Real-time Challenge Timers**: Live countdowns for ongoing challenges (future feature).
- **Advanced Filtering**: Enhanced categorization and filtering of challenges (planned enhancement).
- **Community Forums**: A space for users to discuss techniques, challenges, and other topics (upcoming feature).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native, Expo
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
- **Database**: Firestore with collections for challenges, subcollections for entries and votes, and separate collections for user profiles.

## Database Structure

- **Challenges**: Main collection with details of each challenge.
  - **Entries**: Subcollection under each challenge for user submissions.
  - **Votes**: Subcollection under each entry to store votes.
- **Users**: Collection for storing user profiles and authentication details.
